        <h2>Learn More About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I’m Dominique Wegrzak, the founder of True Form Drafting. My path into mechanical design and drafting started early—through a technical apprenticeship in Germany, where I learned the foundations of engineering from the ground up. While working full-time in the field, I also studied mechanical engineering, combining real-world experience with academic knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, I’ve worked in various roles across the mechanical industry—from operating machines on the shop floor to checking parts for quality after fabrication. I’ve stood beside welders, machinists, and production teams, giving me a deep understanding of how parts are actually made—not just how they’re drawn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along the way, I’ve worked with a range of CAD tools including AutoCAD, AutoDesk Inventor, SolidWorks and Solid Edge. Whether it’s building out a complex assembly or detailing a single part drawing, I focus on creating clean, practical designs that manufacturers can actually use.
        </p>
        <p>
          True Form Drafting is the result of all that hands-on experience. I work directly with manufacturers, inventors, and designers to help them bring their ideas into production, offering not just drawings, but real insight into how things can be built efficiently and accurately.
        </p>
